                    Velocity Platform pilot program.</li>
                <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> We collect information provided during registration, such as

                <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> We collect API usage data, including IP addresses, rendering
                    volumes,
                    and log files.</li>
                <li><strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies:</strong> We use strictly necessary session cookies and

                    We do
                    not use advertising cookies or third-party tracking technologies. You may configure your browser to

                information from anyone under 18. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a
                minor, we will take steps to delete such information promptly.</p>

            <h2>7. DATA TRANSFERS</h2>
            <p>Your information will be processed in the United States (via AWS) and in Israel. Israel is recognized by
                the
                European Commission and the United Kingdom as providing an adequate level of data protection. By using
                the
                Services, you consent to the transfer of information to these jurisdictions. Australian users
                specifically
                acknowledge that while we take reasonable steps to protect your data, these jurisdictions may have
                different
                privacy laws than Australia.</p>

            <h2>8. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by email at
                least
                fourteen (14) days before they take effect. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this Policy indicates
                when
                it was last revised. Your continued use of the Services after changes take effect constitutes acceptance
                of
                the revised Policy.</p>
